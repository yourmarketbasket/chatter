Terms of Use for Chatter

Last Updated: August 15, 2025

Welcome to Chatter! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Chatter mobile application (the "Service"). Chatter is a platform designed for anonymous communication, enabling users to interact without the requirement to disclose personally identifying information, such as email addresses or phone numbers, in alignment with the right to privacy under Article 31 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, and the principles of data minimization under Section 25 of the Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019 (which excludes anonymized data from its scope, as confirmed in interpretations akin to international standards like Recital 26 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation).

By accessing or using our Service, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you may not access or use the Service. Your continued use constitutes acceptance of these Terms, which are enforceable as a binding contract under the Kenyan Law of Contract Act (Cap 23, Laws of Kenya).

1. User Accounts and Anonymity

Users may create an account using only an alias and password. Each account is linked to a unique internal identifier solely for security and abuse-prevention purposes, without collecting or processing personal data as defined under Section 2 of the Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity carried out under your account, as users bear primary liability for their actions under Kenyan law, including Section 53 of the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018 (CMCA), which limits platform liability for user-generated content.

Chatter does not verify or authenticate user identities, promoting the right to anonymity as supported by international human rights standards, including the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression's 2015 report emphasizing anonymity's role in protecting freedom of expression under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Accordingly, you acknowledge that interactions are anonymous and undertaken at your own discretion and risk, with no implied warranty of user authenticity under the implied terms disclaimed per Section 14 of the Kenyan Sale of Goods Act (Cap 31, Laws of Kenya).

2. User Responsibilities and Conduct

You agree not to use the Service to engage in any conduct that violates these Terms or applicable laws. Specifically, you shall not:

- Post, transmit, or share content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, hateful, pornographic, inciteful, or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes false publications under Section 22 of the CMCA (punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 5 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both), cyber harassment under Section 27 of the CMCA (punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 20 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both), child pornography under Section 24 of the CMCA (punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 20 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 25 years, or both), or incitement to violence under Section 96 of the Penal Code (Cap 63, Laws of Kenya) (punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years).

- Engage in harassment, bullying, stalking, or threats, as prohibited under Section 28 of the CMCA (cyberstalking, punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 20 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both) and Section 96 of the Penal Code (inciting to violence, punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years).

- Impersonate any person, group, or organization, which may amount to identity theft under Section 29 of the CMCA (punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both).

- Distribute spam, unsolicited communications, or malicious software, contravening Section 31 of the CMCA (malware distribution, punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both) and Section 32 (spam, punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 5 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both).

- Publish personal or confidential information of others without explicit consent, violating privacy rights under Article 31 of the Kenyan Constitution and Section 48 of the Data Protection Act, 2019 (punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 5 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both, under Section 72 of the Data Protection Act).

- Violate any laws applicable to your jurisdiction, including but not limited to:

  - Kenya’s Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018 (e.g., Sections 16-18 on unauthorized access, punishable by fines up to KES 5 million or imprisonment up to 5 years; Sections 22-23 on false information, punishable by fines up to KES 5 million or imprisonment up to 10 years).

  - Kenya’s Data Protection Act, 2019 (e.g., Sections 25-26 on data processing principles, with penalties under Section 72 including fines up to KES 5 million or imprisonment up to 3 years).

  - Defamation Act (Cap 36, Laws of Kenya) (e.g., Section 3 defining defamation as publication likely to injure reputation, with defenses under Sections 12-15 for fair comment and privilege not extending to platforms under safe harbor provisions; criminal defamation under Section 194 of the Penal Code, punishable by imprisonment up to 2 years).

  - Penal Code (Cap 63, Laws of Kenya) (e.g., Section 77 on unlawful assemblies inciting hatred, punishable by imprisonment up to 3 years; Section 96 on incitement to violence, punishable by imprisonment up to 5 years).

  - National Cohesion and Integration Act, 2008 (e.g., Section 13 prohibiting hate speech that incites discrimination or violence, punishable by a fine not exceeding KES 1 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or both).

  - Applicable international laws, such as Article 19 of the ICCPR (freedom of expression with restrictions on incitement under Article 19(3)), Article 17 of the ICCPR (privacy), Article 20 of the ICCPR (prohibition of advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred constituting incitement), and the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe Treaty No. 185, to which Kenya aligns through the CMCA, criminalizing offenses like child pornography under Article 9 and illegal access under Article 2, with penalties varying by jurisdiction but emphasizing international cooperation).

⚠️ Legal Liability: Users remain solely responsible for their content and behavior on Chatter, as platforms are shielded from liability for third-party content under Section 53 of the CMCA (limiting liability for service providers acting as mere conduits or hosts without actual knowledge, provided they act expeditiously upon notice). You acknowledge that any criminal liability arising from your use, including but not limited to the offenses listed above, rests entirely with you as the content creator or actor, and Chatter disclaims all vicarious or secondary liability under Kenyan common law principles of aiding and abetting (Penal Code Section 20) or international standards like the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Principle 13, encouraging avoidance of complicity without imposing strict criminal sanctions on intermediaries).

3. Content Ownership and License

Chatter does not claim ownership of user-generated content, respecting intellectual property rights under the Kenyan Copyright Act, 2001.

By posting on Chatter, you grant Chatter a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, display, and distribute your content solely for purposes of operating the Service, as necessary for intermediary functions under Section 53 of the CMCA.

You represent that you have full rights to your content and that it does not infringe on third-party rights, including copyrights under Section 35 of the Copyright Act, 2001 (punishable by fines up to KES 500,000 or imprisonment up to 10 years under Section 38), or trademarks under the Trade Marks Act (Cap 506, Laws of Kenya). Any infringement claims shall be directed at the user, not Chatter, per intermediary protections, and users agree to bear all criminal liabilities for such infringements.

4. Platform Moderation

Chatter may, but is not obligated to, remove or restrict content that:

- Violates these Terms.

- Is subject to valid legal requests or takedowns, such as under Section 35 of the CMCA (reporting cyber threats, with non-compliance punishable by fines up to KES 300,000 or imprisonment up to 2 years) or court orders.

- Poses risks of liability, in line with due diligence obligations under international frameworks like the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (requiring expeditious removal upon notice for hosting services, with potential fines up to 6% of global turnover for systemic failures).

Chatter does not guarantee active monitoring of all user activity, as mandatory monitoring could infringe on freedom of expression under Article 33(1) of the Kenyan Constitution and impose disproportionate burdens contrary to the proportionality test in international human rights law (e.g., Article 19(3) ICCPR). However, failure by users to comply with these standards may result in their own criminal prosecution, as outlined in Section 2, without imposing any criminal liability on Chatter provided safe harbors are maintained.

5. Legal Disclaimers and Safe Harbor

Chatter is a neutral hosting platform and does not endorse or assume responsibility for user content, invoking safe harbor protections under:

- Section 53 of the Kenya Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018 (no liability for intermediaries without knowledge or if acting expeditiously on notice; loss of protection could expose to aiding offenses under Section 56, punishable as per the underlying crime).

- Article 33 of the Kenyan Constitution (freedom of expression, subject to limits under subsection (2) on incitement, hate speech, and advocacy of hatred, with platforms not liable for user violations per intermediary rules).

- Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act (platforms not treated as publishers of user content, providing immunity from criminal prosecution for third-party content).

- Articles 4-6 of the EU Digital Services Act (exemptions for mere conduit, caching, and hosting services if neutral and no active role, with obligations to remove illegal content upon awareness, and potential criminal referrals for non-compliance under national laws).

Users agree that Chatter is not liable for defamation (per Defamation Act Cap 36 and Penal Code Section 194), harassment, or unlawful activity carried out by other users, as liability rests with the content originator under these frameworks. Specifically, Chatter disclaims any criminal liability for facilitating offenses unless proven to have actual knowledge and willful intent under CMCA Section 56, in which case underlying penalties (e.g., up to 25 years for child pornography) could apply, but Chatter commits to expeditious action to preserve safe harbor status.

6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, including Section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act (disclaiming implied warranties) and general tort principles under Kenyan common law:

Chatter, its developers, employees, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages, including reputational harm, defamation claims, harassment suits, or loss of profits arising from user interactions.

Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless Chatter from all claims, damages, costs, and legal proceedings arising from their use of the Service, as enforceable under the Kenyan Law of Contract Act, including any criminal proceedings where users are prosecuted for offenses like those in Section 2.

Chatter expressly disclaims any liability for failure to prevent or remove harmful, defamatory, or unlawful content, relying on user reporting and safe harbor provisions. In the event of criminal investigations targeting Chatter (e.g., under CMCA Section 43 for corporate offenses, punishable by fines up to KES 50 million), users acknowledge that such risks are minimized through neutrality, but any user actions leading to platform exposure shall trigger full indemnification.

7. Law Enforcement and Compliance

Chatter complies with lawful requests from courts or authorities, such as under Section 50 of the CMCA (cooperation with investigations, with non-compliance punishable by fines up to KES 10 million for corporations or KES 5 million and 3 years imprisonment for officers) and Section 31 of the Data Protection Act, 2019 (lawful disclosures, with violations punishable under Section 72).

However, due to the anonymous design of the Service, compliant with anonymity protections under international standards (e.g., UN Special Rapporteur reports):

- No email addresses, phone numbers, or location data are collected or stored, limiting disclosures to non-personal data under the Data Protection Act.

- The only identifiers available for disclosure are the alias/username created by the user and an internal system-generated ID that is not linked to any real-world identity.

Users understand that:

- Chatter cannot provide personal identity details beyond the alias/username, as anonymity is protected unless restrictions are necessary and proportionate per Article 19(3) ICCPR.

- Law enforcement and third parties must rely on independent investigations to identify users, with no liability on Chatter for inability to trace per safe harbor laws.

- Failure to comply with requests could lead to criminal charges against Chatter under CMCA Section 52 (non-cooperation in data collection, punishable by fines up to KES 10 million or imprisonment up to 3 years), but Chatter commits to full cooperation within the limits of available data to avoid such liabilities.

By using Chatter, you agree that the developer cannot be held liable for the inability to trace users or disclose further identity information, as this design aligns with privacy rights, and any criminal misuse by users (e.g., aiding terrorism under CMCA Section 30, punishable by up to 20 years) shall not impose vicarious criminal liability on Chatter.

8. International Use

Users accessing Chatter from outside Kenya are responsible for complying with their local laws, including international obligations under treaties like the ICCPR and the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (criminalizing cyber offenses with penalties including imprisonment and fines, emphasizing state cooperation without direct platform liability unless complicit).

Chatter makes no guarantee that the Service is lawful in every jurisdiction but operates under Kenyan law as the governing framework, disclaiming criminal liabilities arising from jurisdictional conflicts.

9. Waiver of Harassment and Defamation Claims Against Chatter

Users expressly waive any right to bring harassment, defamation, or reputational harm claims against Chatter, directing such claims solely against the user who generated the content, as supported by intermediary immunity under Section 53 of the CMCA and equivalent international provisions. This includes waiving claims for criminal offenses like cyber harassment (CMCA Section 27) or defamation (Penal Code Section 194), to the extent permitted by law.

This waiver is binding to the extent permitted by Kenyan law and does not affect mandatory consumer protections.

10. Class Action Waiver

Users agree that any claims must be brought on an individual basis.

You waive the right to participate in class actions, collective suits, or representative claims against Chatter, as class actions may be limited under Kenyan procedural law (e.g., Civil Procedure Act, Cap 21) and arbitration preferences, including those related to criminal liabilities.

11. Disclaimers

The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind. Chatter disclaims all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for purpose, and non-infringement, per Section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act and common law principles. This extends to disclaimers of criminal liabilities for platform failures in preventing user crimes, as detailed herein.

12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of Kenya.

Disputes shall first be resolved amicably. Failing that, disputes shall be referred to final and binding arbitration in Nairobi, Kenya, under the Arbitration Act (No. 4 of 1995, Laws of Kenya), with international users agreeing to this without prejudice to mandatory protections under their local laws (e.g., consumer rights under the Rome I Regulation for EU users). This includes disputes arising from alleged criminal liabilities, which shall be resolved without admitting platform fault.

13. Changes to Terms

Chatter may revise these Terms periodically. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms, with notice provided in-app where required by law.

14. Criminal Liabilities: Exhaustive Provisions and Disclaimers

To ensure comprehensive coverage, this section expounds on potential criminal liabilities related to the Service, emphasizing user responsibility and platform protections under Kenyan and international law.

- **User Criminal Liabilities**: As the primary actors, users are fully liable for any criminal offenses committed via the Service, including but not limited to those detailed in Section 2 (e.g., CMCA offenses with penalties ranging from fines of KES 5-50 million and imprisonment of 3-25 years). Under Penal Code Section 20, users may also be liable as joint offenders if aiding others in crimes. Internationally, this aligns with the Budapest Convention's criminalization of acts like illegal interception (Article 3, penalties per national law) without intermediary liability.

- **Platform Criminal Liabilities and Disclaimers**: Chatter, as an intermediary, invokes Section 53 of the CMCA to disclaim criminal liability for user content unless it has actual knowledge and fails to act expeditiously (per Section 56, potentially exposing to penalties of the underlying offense). Specific risks include:
  - **Facilitating User Crimes**: If deemed to aid offenses (e.g., hosting child pornography under CMCA Section 24), liability could arise under CMCA Section 43 (corporate offenses, fines up to KES 50 million) or Penal Code Section 20 (aiding, penalties per underlying crime). Chatter disclaims this by committing to removal upon notice and maintaining neutrality, as per EU DSA Article 6 (no general monitoring obligation to avoid complicity claims).
  - **Non-Compliance with Authorities**: Failure to cooperate (CMCA Section 50-52) could result in fines up to KES 10 million or imprisonment up to 3 years. Chatter disclaims by affirming compliance within data limits, aligned with ICCPR Article 17 (privacy protections limiting disclosures).
  - **Corporate or Reporting Failures**: Under CMCA Section 9 (reporting threats, non-compliance fines up to KES 300,000 or 2 years imprisonment) or Section 43, corporate liability could apply if operators knowingly enable threats. Chatter disclaims through voluntary reporting and due diligence, per UN Guiding Principles (Principle 17, human rights impact assessments).
  - **Anonymity-Related Risks**: The design may be scrutinized for enabling untraceable crimes (e.g., incitement under National Cohesion Act Section 13), but Chatter disclaims liability as anonymity is lawful under Kenyan Constitution Article 31 and ICCPR Article 19, with no mandatory de-anonymization absent court orders.

Users agree that Chatter shall not be criminally liable in these areas, indemnifying against any proceedings, and acknowledge that exhaustive safe harbors minimize risks, with any platform exposure (e.g., via CMCA amendments) not attributable to users.
